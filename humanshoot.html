   <p>You fire your crossbow and hit the witch in the chest with your arrow. She falls from her broom and dies, but not before casting a spell on you. She has cursed you to die the moment you acheive happiness. Unfortunately you are estatic that the witch is killed so you suffer a heart attack and die. The end.
